# Fibo Even Sum

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

											1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed the `n`th term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Code

```js
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let table = [1, 2];
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) table.push(table[i - 2] + table[i - 1]);
  return table.filter(a => a % 2 === 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b);
}
```
